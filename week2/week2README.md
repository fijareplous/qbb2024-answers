# Question 2.3

## 1. Which feature appears to be under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection? How can you tell? 

Exons are under the most negative selection. The slope of the line for exons is much sharper; as the minor allele frequency increases, the SNP enrichment dramatically decreases compared to the other features. 

## 2. Why do you think most features start out more enriched at lower MAFs and become more depleted as the MAF increases?
Lower MAF values represent less variability in the specific SNP and thus a lower frequency of the minor allele. This therefore increases the tolerance of additional SNPs, meaning that that specific loci is more enriched overall. This trend is reversed at higher MAF values. Higher MAF values represent more variability in the specific SNP and thus a greater frequency of the minor allele. This therefore decreases the tolerance of additional SNPs, meaning that the specific loci is less enriched overall.

## 3. Does the relative levels of enrichment/depletion of features with respect to each other make sense? Explain.
I beleive they make sense. Exons, for instance, are protein coding and thus are subject to more pressure in terms of mutagenics. Introns are understandably on the other end of the spectrumâ€”because they are spliced out, mutations in those sequences are not as consequential. cCREs and other features of the genome fall between these two extremes, which makes sense given that their positions on the graph fall between introns and exons.
