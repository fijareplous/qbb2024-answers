# Week 10 Homework Answers

## Q3.1: What do each of these values mean, based on the descriptions of what is being labeled?

#### The nascent RNA signal refers to the level of transcription occuring in the given knockdown strain through nascent RNA abundance. PCNA signal refers to the level of DNA replication as a function of PCNA, which plays a critical role in DNA replication. The log2 ratio therefore represents the ratio of nascent RNA to DNA production in a given KD strain. 

## Q3.2: Look at the knocked-down gene with the highest ratio and the one with the lowest ratio. Look up what their functions are and explain if you think this result makes sense.

#### SRSF1 has the highest ratio. SRSF1 (or serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1) plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing (1). It makes sense that SRSF1 would have a high ratio comparitively, as knocking it down would result in an increase in RNA production, leading to a higher log2 ratio. 

#### APEX1, which has the lowest ratio, encodes a endonuclease involved in DNA repair (2). It makes sense that APEX1 would have the lowest ratio, as knocking down APEX1 would lead to an accumulation of DNA damage, therefore recruiting PCNA, increasing the PCNA signal, and thus decreasing the log2 ratio.
